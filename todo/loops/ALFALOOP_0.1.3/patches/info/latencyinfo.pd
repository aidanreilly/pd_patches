LATENCY Important: Before going for the "latency-test"-
button \, make sure your speakers are muted. Do not wear headphones neither.
Choose test-in and output and connect them (directly) with a cable. Now push "latency-test". Note: The latency shown is not the actual latency of your system \, it's the magic number needed to compensate properly. There is no need to stress your system \, latency gets properly corrected. The only difference between a fast and a slow system is the time it takes to playback - once started \, the playback jumps right into the right place. So if you're on a slow system \, get used to play slightly over the endpoint. Adjust "x-fade" until you feel comfortable. Drag "x-offset" to the minimum to avoid further delay of the playback. It's highly recommended to use midi- controllers plugged in directly to your soundcard instead of using separate device (internal midi). You can set latency also manually by typing/dragging. Adjust to the way you stomp foot-switches...
