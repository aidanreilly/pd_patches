#X text 288 4 auduioflow~ - delay with forward-backward looper;
#X text 290 413 Peace \; -svanya;
#X text 287 24 audioflow~ is an audio patch which does the follow.
\; \; It takes an incoming signal and sends it to a delay~. \; It then
sends the vd~ read signal to a looper as well as the delayed signal
to the outlet. \; \; When record is pressed on the looper a sample
record begins recording the vd~ read line. \; It also is then sent
to out. \; \; The direction either forward or back of the loop is controlled
by the vector. So - speeds are played in reverse \, and positive speeds
are played forward. \; \; The pitch of the loop may also be controlled.
\; \; Not sure if this is even necessary but a further multiplier(-1
to 1) may be applied to the loop. \; \; The info: positional bar is
not a control and only shows the speed and direction of the loop. \;
\; Each channel \, raw \, delay \, and loop \, may be mixed using the
gain controls. \; And an overall gain control is at the bottom. \;
\; Notes: after you stop recording the loop begins to play automatically.
And you can merely tap record again and play stops automatically.;
