direction/speed control quantized to musical intervals.
* No quantization a stand still to double speed forward or backward.
* Quantization resulting in chromatic intervals across +/- 1 octave forward or backwards
* Quantization to only perfect fifths and octaves across +/- 1 octave forward or backwards

slice the buffer. play a slice of the buffer
* dir/speed
* random  - with RAND turned all the way down the slice always starts at the beginning of the recorded sound, but as you increase RAND the start of the slice is 

3 buffer looper - put the loop into three seperate buffers.

Notes see guitar looper extended for reversing
