VOLUMES "loud(feedb)" means: Stay loud \, feedback! Assume you record with a feedback-level of less than 1\. This is nice \, for it let you blend to a new timing/loop. If you stop the recording \, though \, the feedback naturally carry on to diminish the loop-volume every loop-round. If "loud(feedb)" is set to "on" \, the feedback-level gets internally set to 100% again right after the recording. The "feedback"-canvas starts blinking and your feedback-pedal/fader will be taken out of order. Any touching of the feedback-control is useless \, it stays at 100%. Only turning your pedal/fader to full level will free the feedback-control again (steady color again). Same goes for "loud(over)" \, with a slight difference: The ducking-level does not affect the play-pack-volume after overdubbing. But \, if "auto-over" is set to "on" (with "ducking-level" less than 1) \, it easily happens that you instantly over-record your recordings after recording. "overkill" turns off overdubbing during recordings.
